TODO:
- [ ] advertise the notifications channel in well-known
- [ ] advertise the notifications channel in HTTP headers
- [ ] reinstate the updates-via header in HEAD requests, which was removed from solid-crud

- [ ] add notifications controller
- [ ] handle register requests - this must validate that the requestor has read access to the resource;
- [ ] handle unregister requests - only the webid that subscribed should be able to unsubscribe
- [ ] implement function to get subscription in SolidWebHook

Backlog / later:
- [ ] add actor to notifications
- [ ] add UUID to notifications
- [ ] Add support for the rate limit feature.
- [ ] create a solid-notifications-lastsent database table - columns are subscription_id and lastsent;
- [ ] how can we stop sending notifications when read access was revoked?

Done:
- [v] create a solid-notifications-subscription database table - columns should have: id, webid, path, url, expiry
